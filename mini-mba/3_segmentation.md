Reasons for segmenting

- Market orientation demands it.

Demographic segmentation does not inform / predict behaviour.

when segmenting - behavioural / outcome questions, then segment and model out by demographics / attitudinal to understand what makes your segments different.

## Steps

1. What are all available attributes we can use to segment?
2. Rate variables on 1-10 scale of how meaningful it is for customer behaviour.
3. Rate variables 1-10 for actionability. Do I have the data, can I use it?
4. Multiply 2x3 to rank your varaibles.

## Assessing segmentation

- Does it include the whole market?
- Can a customer belong to only one segment?
- Are they homogenous inside, heterogenous to other segments?
- Are the names based on behaviour?
- Is the segmentation sized & valued correctly?
- Do the segments make intuitive sense to salespeople?
