# Segment dynamics

Look for segments with spillover - i.e. their behaviours may be adjacent to other segments who will also buy from you. They are like the entrance rooms to other parts of the house.

This is the point of dynamic targeting - how one segment influences many more.

A&F case study - alienate others to reinforce the attributes of your target segment.
